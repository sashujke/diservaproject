### Writing code
- write clear and clean code
- use types and interfaces
  all components must have `IProps{componentName}`
- use const/let when you use a value more than once
- format code before adding to a commit
- be sure to use eslint and prittierrc
- namming
  + if a variable has a boolean value, its name must begin with is or has
    * example:
    ```TypeScript
    // namming/example.boolean.ts
    const [isOpen, setOpen] = useState<boolean>(false);
    ...
    const hasValue: boolean = ...
    
    ```
  + for local function use `_` before name
    * example:
    ```TypeScript
    // namming/example.local.ts
    function _countLikes() {
     ...
    }
    
    ```
- use `index.ts` for import all stuff from folder
  * example:
    ```TypeScript
    // src/components/index.ts
    export * from './header';
    export * from './footer';
    ```
